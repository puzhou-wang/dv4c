    "LC X MS refers to the tandem usage of liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) in the identification and quantification of compounds, especially in mixture samples. LC X MS technqiue is powerful because it marries two orthogonal characterization dimensions, the affinity dimension from LC and the mass dimension from MS."

In LC X MS applications, there is usually another column in the MS data to represent the retention time (also called elution time) of the sample examined in MS.

In this example data, the entire column of *time* contains the same value, 12.34, which suggests that this piece of data represents the MS scan generated at this specific timestamp during the LC analysis.\n",
