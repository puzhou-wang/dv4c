The deconvoluted data for each sample is plotted as a single line, with samples grouped by conditions. The color codes are used to designate both the peaks representing desired products (i.e., flp) and the truncations based on the identity of the nucleotide. As our brains are well tuned to spot patterns, it is clear by a quick glance at the waterfall plot that condition B generates less truncation than condition A. Condition B may be better synthesis and/or more careful storage of the DNA molecules."
